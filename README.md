# Proposed Charter for a W3C EPUB 3 Working Group

Any text in this repository should be considered as a draft. The goal is to submit it, at some point, to the W3C Advisory Committee for approval.

The [properly rendered version](https://w3c.github.io/epub-3-wg-charter/) is also available. 

2010-08-21: the charter has been accepted by W3C (see the [final version](https://www.w3.org/2020/08/epub-wg-charter.html)) and the [EPUB 3 Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg) is now operationa. This charter is therefore archived.
