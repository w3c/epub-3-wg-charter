				<h1>DRAFT</h1>
				<p>
					This is a <em>draft</em> text, under development by the community. The W3C Advisory Committee has been informed on the development this draft. 
					The goal is to, eventually, submit this draft charter proposal into a draft for an official W3C AC review.
				</p>
				<p>
					This proposed charter is available on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-3-wg-charter">GitHub</a>. Feel free to raise <a href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-3-wg-charter/issues">issues</a></i>.

			<p class="mission">
				The <strong>mission</strong> of the EPUB 3 Working Group is to maintain and develop the EPUB 3 family of specifications, to represent the EPUB community in the W3C, and to support EPUB content creators and consumers by further advancing, refining, and clarifying the current EPUB specification. The Working Group will also work closely with the Publishing Community Group to support the maintenance of validation tools and the creation of documentation.

      		<section id="scope" class="scope">
        		<h2>Scope</h2>
				<p>
					EPUB is a distribution and interchange format for digital publications and documents. The EPUB format provides a means of representing, packaging, and encoding structured and semantically enhanced Web content—including HTML, CSS, SVG and other resources—for distribution in a single-file container. 

				</p>	

				<p>
					EPUB 3 is a direct descendant of the original <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20101212174917/http://idpf.org/oebps/oebps1.0/index.htm">OEB 1.0</a> from 1999, using an XML package file for structural and bibliographic metadata, packaged using <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub3/epub-ocf.html">OCF</a>. EPUB 3 is strongly related to, and reliant upon, W3C specifications: all the relevant content within a digital publication are defined in <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">HTML</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html">CSS</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/">SVG</a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/">, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML/">MathML</a>, etc. The EPUB 3 format provides a method to include metadata within the package, as well as a packaging format. These features align with the current distribution model of the digital publishing market. The latest version of EPUB 3 was published as a W3C Final Community Group Specification as <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub32/epub-overview.html">EPUB 3.2</a> and is already largely used by the industry. The work defined by this charter relies on that version of EPUB 3.  

				</p>					
				
				<p>
					Following the work that went into EPUB 3.2 to simplify the specification, there is more to be done, particularly in addressing issues with user agent conformance. The next version of EPUB will be easier to understand and use, and should allow for more types of publications. During the development of the next version of EPUB 3, there will be a strong emphasis on enhancing reading system conformance across the board via rigorous testing of the specifications and providing a comprehensive test suite that reading system implementers may also use. As part of its activity the Working Group will also ensure an even stronger alignment with relevant W3C specifications in terms of the content that a digital publication relies on.
				</p>					
				
				<p>
					EPUB 3.X will endeavor to remain compatible with existing content. Any EPUB 3.2 publication should be valid under any new version of EPUB published by this Working Group, unless it relies on features that are subject to errata on EPUB 3.2. In particular all EPUB 3 specifications defined by this Working Group will use <code style="color:black">version=”3.0”</code> for the package file, to ensure compatibility with previous versions of EPUB 3.
				</p>					
				
				<p>
					There should be thorough review of internationalization issues. While the content of a digital publication is in HTML, SVG, etc., which already have advanced internationalization features, an EPUB 3 publication also has EPUB 3 specific textual content like metadata, table of contents, etc., which must also abide to all requirements of internationalization. 
				</p>

				<h2>Success Criteria</h2>
				<p>
					In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of each of feature defined in the specification.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each specification should contain a section detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.
				</p>
				<p>
					There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
					recommendations for maximizing accessibility in implementations.
				</p>
				<p>
					To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.

      		<section id="coordination">
        		<h2>Coordination</h2>
        		<p>
					For all specifications, this Working Group Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The Working Group Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of each specification.  The Working Group Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.

					This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="[link to Github repo]">GitHub issues</a>. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
				</p>
				<p>
					The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

				<h2>
				Decision Policy
				</h2>
				<p>
					This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
				<p>
					However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
				</p>
				<p>
					To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from 5 to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group Group.
				</p>
				<p>
					All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
				</p>
				<p>
					This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
