      		<section id="scope" class="scope">
				<h2>Scope</h2>

				<p>
					EPUB is a distribution and interchange format for digital publications and documents that has been in global use by publishers and vendors for over a decade. The latest version of EPUB, <a href='https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub32/epub-spec.html'>EPUB 3.2</a>, has been published by the <a href='https://www.w3.org/community/epub3/'>W3C EPUB 3 Community Group</a> as a Final Specification. EPUB 3 is strongly related to, and reliant upon, W3C specifications: it provides a means of representing, packaging, and encoding structured and semantically enhanced Web content—including <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">HTML</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html">CSS</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/">SVG</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML/">MathML</a> and other resources—for distribution in a single–file container.
				</p>

				<p>
					However, the interoperability of EPUB 3 content, and the conformance of EPUB 3 reading systems, remain a serious issue. There is a need for a more rigorous and comprehensive testing of EPUB 3; this may also mean the need for a further clarification of the standard text itself. These needs were reinforced and informed by the community in a survey Publishing@W3C sent out to the digital publishing community in February 2020. An overview of the results and link to the complete results can be found <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/2020/05/publishingw3c-epub-survey-results/">here</a>. (See also the <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/2020/03/listen-to-the-people-the-future-of-epub-and-new-directions-for-publishing-w3c/">separate blog</a> for more background.) The EPUB 3 Working Group will advance, refine, and clarify the EPUB 3 standard to ensure its relevance as digital publishing continues to evolve, and specify a comprehensive testing environment for EPUB 3. 
				</p>

				<p>
					The Working Group will produce a new version of EPUB 3, codenamed “EPUB 3.X” for the purposes of this charter; the Working Group will have to define the correct numbering scheme (e.g., EPUB 3.2.1, or EPUB 3.3, etc.). The Working Group will <em>not</em> change the EPUB 3.2 specification itself.
				</p>

				<p>
					The scope of the EPUB 3 Working Group includes the following:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Improvements and clarifications related to reading system conformance.
					</li>
					<li>
						Development of a test suite to check reading system conformance.
					</li>
					<li>
						Clarifications to the current use of open Web technologies, such as supported JavaScript APIs and CSS modules.
					</li>
					<li>
						Enhancements and improvements to internationalization of technologies defined for EPUB to ensure global usability. While the content of a digital publication (HTML, CSS, etc.) already have advanced internationalization features, an EPUB 3 publication also includes additional textual content like metadata, table of contents, etc., which must abide to all requirements of internationalization.
					</li>
					<li>
						Continued integration of errata and bug fixes.
					</li>
					<li>
						Integration of new Open Web Platform technologies for enhanced digital publishing experiences; these may include, but not limited to:
						<ul>
							<li>
								new media types, such as OPUS, BPG, or WebP;
							</li>
							<li>
								allowing the HTML Serialization of HTML5, including whether and how to handle xml-specific technologies like <code>epub:type</code> and the <code>ssml:*</code> attributes.
							</li>
						</ul>
						Such new technical features should be incubated by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/publishingcg/">Publishing Community Group</a> before being considered by this Working Group.  Also, the effects on deployed systems and checking tools, and the risk of additional cost for adoption, must be carefully analyzed. In case of doubt, such features should not be added to EPUB 3.X.
					</li>
					<li>
						Improvements to the <a href='#a11y'>EPUB Accessibility</a> specification, that may include, but not be limited to:
						<ul>
							<li>
								considering improvements for facilitating early adoption of EPUB Accessibility in Europe, while seeking a stronger international consensus on specifications through W3C discussion;
							</li>
							<li>
								enhancing EPUB Accessibility features, for instance by: aligning with advancements in WCAG; explore possibility of adding accessibility requirements for fixed layout documents (FXL); updating EPUB Accessibility to align with the evolving EPUB3 suite.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Maintenance of EPUB registries.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					The primary goal of EPUB 3.X is to remain compatible with existing content. <em>Any existing valid EPUB 3.2 should remain valid under EPUB 3.X, unless it relies on features discovered to have serious issues (such as a security bug).</em>
				</p>

				<p>
					The Working Group will also work with other groups, as appropriate, in the development of standards for digital publishing (e.g., an update to the <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria-1.0/'>Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module</a>).
				</p>

				<section id="section-out-of-scope">
					<h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
					<p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this Working Group group.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Removal of any existing features defined by EPUB 3.2. 
						Existing features will only be deprecated if they are not needed 
						to support existing EPUB 3 content, as stated in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#support-existing-content">HTML’s design principles</a>.</li>
						<li>Digital Rights Management (DRM).</li>
						<li>New serialization format for the <a href='https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub32/epub-packages.html#sec-package-doc'>EPUB Package Document</a>.</li>
						<li>Changes to the EPUB Package Document <a href='https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub32/epub-packages.html#sec-package-elem'>version number</a>. The number will remain "3.0" to ensure reading systems do not reject EPUB 3 files.</li>
						<li>Alternatives to the <a href='https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub32/epub-ocf.html'>EPUB Open Container format</a>.</li>
						<li>Any new elements, attributes, properties, or values that would create a fork from open web technologies (e.g., HTML, CSS or SVG).</li>
						<li>Any new Package Document properties or values that influence rendering inside viewports that can be deferred to more appropriate working groups.</li>
						<li>EPUB authoring tools.</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Success Criteria</h2>

				<p>The EPUB 3 Working Group’s work is considered a success
				if:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>There are multiple, independent, interoperable implementations
					of EPUB 3.X that are widely used.</li>
					<li>Existing content is supported. All conforming EPUB 3.2 publications should remain conformant to EPUB 3.X.</li>
					<li>Improvements to the standard solve immediate and quantifiable issues faced in the EPUB ecosystem.</li>
					<li>Changes that affect the global ecosystem
					(including authors, publishers, distributors, retailers, reading systems, and tool makers)
					are minimized, and made only after careful consideration
					of how they would affect all constituencies.</li>
					<li>Validation tools such as EPUBCheck fully support EPUB 3.X.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of each of feature defined in the specification.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each specification should contain a section detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.
				</p>
				<p>
					There must be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
					recommendations for maximizing accessibility in implementations.
				</p>
				<p>
					To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications must have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.
				</p>
			</section>

      		<section id="coordination">
        		<h2>Coordination</h2>
        		<p>
					For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.
				</p>

        		<p>
					Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:

								An earlier version of EPUB (<a href="http://idpf.org/epub/301">EPUB 3.0.1</a>) was published as an ISO standard ISO/IEC TS 30135:2014 (parts 1-7). This Working Group and ISO may consider updating that ISO specification once the new Recommendations are published.
							</p>
							<p>
								Additionally, there are currently activities within <a href="https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=8913149&objAction=browse&sort=name">ISO/IEC JTC 001/SC34</a> on specifications that rely on earlier versions of EPUB (e.g., EPUB Preservation, EPUB Accessibility). A liaison has to be maintained on, possibly, updating those ISO specifications to the latest versions of EPUB 3, specified by this Working Group.

					Participation
				</h2>
				<p>
					To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
				</p>
				<p>
					The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
					W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.

				<h2>
					Communication
				</h2>
				<p id="public">
					Technical discussions for this Working Group Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editors’ Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
					The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
				</p>
				<p>
					Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a class=todo href="[link to the WG home page]">EPUB 3 Working Group home page.</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Most EPUB 3 Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
				</p>
				<p>
					This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="[link to Github repo]">GitHub issues</a>. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
				</p>
				<p>
					The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

			<section id="decisions">
				<h2>
				Decision Policy
				</h2>
				<p>
					This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
				<p>
					However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
				</p>
				<p>
					To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from 5 to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group Group.
				</p>
				<p>
					All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
				</p>
				<p>
					This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
